_(please **do not** install this yet, it's not finished! In particular, it currently [sends the URL you tried to access as a parameter](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/just-fields/blob/96380cb90c7fc2b35d2dc594e8d08792e9d052c2/extension/background.js#L104) when it redirects to the 'fields' image. I'm intending to use this on my own machine to start mapping out partially what is hosted there, but i'd not want to invade anyone else's privacy in this way without a robust informed consent / research ethics framework in place. I might try and do a more formal / controlled study along these lines in the future! [Get in touch](mailto:tim@timcowlishaw.co.uk) if this sort of thing interests you and i'll let you know if and when it happens.)_
